Created the following files files for my portfolio: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.


Utilized Bootstrap to develop my portfolio site with the following items:


A working navbar with a working mobile dropdown

A responsive layout

Responsive images

A webpage that utilizes the bootstrap grid system with columns, rows, and nested columns/rows.

I did not utilize extra media queries in the portfolio.
