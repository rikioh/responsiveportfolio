                The story is about a young man who has learned the art of Qigong from one of Chiang Kai-shek's bodyguards and has become so strong that he can literally punch holes through people and solid objects. 
                It was serialized in Business Jump from 1987 to 1990 and later published in 12 volumes.

                The titular antihero of the story, he was separated from his younger brother Nachi since childhood and was adopted by the affluent Saiga family, and grew up to be a very violent person and has a vicious temper and prefers to be alone, because of this he is referred to as a "Wolf". 
                Despite this however, he hides a softer side of kindness and sympathy. He also has a strong belief in karma and shows ruthlessness towards evil doers. Riki-Oh is shown to be a muscular man with fairly long flowing hair. 
                His most distinguishing features are five bullet wounds on his chest and a scar which is the Hexagram or Star of David on his right hand which is the source of his great strength and skill.

            <p class="card-text">By the year 2001, all correctional facilities have been privatized. Lik Wong/Ricky Ho, a martial artist, and former music student, is sentenced to 10 years in prison for manslaughter after killing a crime lord indirectly responsible for the death of his girlfriend 
              Keiko/Anne after a group of thugs chased her off the building to her death after witnessing their heroin deal. It is revealed in a flashback Ricky's name as a child was Rick, but his uncle, after seeing how strong he was, decided the name Ricky was more suitable. It is also revealed that 
              Ricky has multiple bullets inside him that he received from his attack on the crime lord, which he refused to remove because he considers them souvenirs.</p>
